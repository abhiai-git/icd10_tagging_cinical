# ICD10 Tagging of Cinical Documents

This repository contains the complete work for my Master's Thesis project conducted at IIT Chicago. This thesis represents a significant research effort, culminating in a comprehensive study and implementation.

## Overview

This project encompasses all aspects of the thesis, from initial literature review and experimental code development to result analysis and the final thesis document. It is structured to provide a clear and organized overview of the entire research process.

## Project Structure

- `Code/`: Contains all source code developed for the thesis, including experimental implementations, data processing scripts, and any other relevant programming artifacts.
- `Literature/`: Stores research papers, articles, and other academic resources that formed the basis of the literature review for the thesis.
- `Result/`: Holds the outcomes of experiments, data visualizations, statistical analyses, and any other generated results from the research.
- `Thesis Writing/`: Contains the drafts, chapters, and the final version of the thesis document itself, likely in formats such as LaTeX or Word.
- `Weekly Reports/`: Includes periodic progress reports submitted during the thesis development phase, documenting milestones, challenges, and future plans.

## Thesis Topic (Inferred)

Based on the structure, this thesis likely involved:
- **Extensive coding and experimentation** (`Code/`, `Result/`)
- **Thorough academic research and literature review** (`Literature/`)
- **Structured documentation and reporting** (`Thesis Writing/`, `Weekly Reports/`)

## How to Navigate

- To understand the research background, refer to the `Literature/` directory.
- For the technical implementation, explore the `Code/` directory.
- To review the findings and data, check the `Result/` directory.
- The complete thesis document can be found in `Thesis Writing/`.
- Progress updates are available in `Weekly Reports/`.
